# AnimeNimo

Welcome to our practice website! This project is created to showcase our skills in React development. The website pulls anime data from the Jikan API, a popular API for accessing a vast collection of anime information.

As a learning project, this website allows us to experiment with various React features, including routing with React Router v6, state management using Context API and Redux Toolkit, and styling with TailwindCSS and daisyUI. We also utilize Axios for efficient API requests and ensure a smooth user experience throughout the site.

Feel free to explore, search for your favorite anime, and experience how we bring this project to life with React and the Jikan API!
